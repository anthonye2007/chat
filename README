Files:
 - chat.c -- source code that combines the simple-talk client and server
 - Makefile -- used to compile the source code
 - README -- this file

Compilation Instructions:
Navigate to correct directory after unzipping the files and run `make`.
This will generate an executable called chat.
There are some warnings from the compiler but no errrors.

How to run:
Type `./chat` to run the executable in server mode.
Type `./chat -s hostname -p 1234` where hostname is the hostname or IP
address of the server and 1234 is the port number.

Challenges:
My main challenge was having to think about the low-level things again.
It was also difficult to work in a different environment, but is a
useful skill to know.
THANK YOU FOR INSTALLING GIT!!
 (although I didn't realize it was installed until I was done, but hey,
 at least I have it commited for next time:) )
