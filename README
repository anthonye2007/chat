Files:
 - chat.c -- source code that combines the simple-talk client and server
 - badChat.c -- exact same code as chat.c except includes a bad checksum
 - Makefile -- used to compile the source code
 - README -- this file

Compilation Instructions:
Navigate to correct directory after unzipping the files and run `make`.
This will generate executables called chat and badChat.
There are some warnings from the compiler but no errrors.

How to run:
Type `./chat` to run the executable in server mode.
Type `./chat -s hostname -p 1234` where hostname is the hostname or IP
address of the server and 1234 is the port number.

To test the bad checksum version:
Type `./badChat` to run the executable in server mode.
Type `./badChat -s hostname -p 1234` where hostname is the hostname or IP
address of the server and 1234 is the port number.

Challenges:
I had accidently hardcoded the size of the packet in send() which was
causing my client to skip a receive cycle and screwed everything up.
I also had complications with computing the checksum. The logic
seemed fine to me but I had a hard time getting the data types right.
